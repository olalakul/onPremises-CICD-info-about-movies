# Info about Movies: my first flask app
This is a demo code and a testing example for my learning  of RESTful, flask, jenkins, docker ... so far.

It searches some specific information about the movie in the IMDB, makes some processing and presents results in the table.

## Why?
I am a Data Scientist. I build Machine Learning models und bring them to Business-Users.
Once upon a time my model gave an "unexpectedly" excellent result and the Business-Users could not believe it.
"Give us a RESTful API and we will test it ourselves" said they. 

Give you WHAT ... ? 

In Germany, they say "The customer is the king". So, this is how on the King'S order my closer acquaintance with the 
RESTful and flask began. Later I learned some DevOps and used this real-life project for testing. 
I am planning to use it further for future learning and testing. New technologies are welcome.
